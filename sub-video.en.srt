1 
00:00:0,000 --> 00:00:2,720 
 Am I the asshole for telling my sister 

2 
00:00:2,720 --> 00:00:6,040 
 she isn't the type of person I want my daughters to look up to? 

3 
00:00:7,120 --> 00:00:9,920 
 My sister and I are complete opposite. 

4 
00:00:9,920 --> 00:00:12,320 
 My sister doesn't have many accomplishments, 

5 
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:14,680 
 and the last thing I remember her achieving 

6 
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:16,640 
 is graduating high school. 

7 
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:19,960 
 At 20, she dropped out of college because she was pregnant. 

8 
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:21,400 
 She moved in with the father, 

9 
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:23,960 
 and for 10 years they were a family. 

10 
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:26,040 
 All that time she didn't had a job 

11 
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:28,720 
 even when her sons started school. 

12 
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:30,160 
 Those two never married, 

13 
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:32,600 
 and he left her about two years ago. 

14 
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:34,240 
 She is now pregnant again, 

15 
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:35,880 
 new dad isn't involved, 

16 
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:38,760 
 works at fast food and barely scraps by. 

17 
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:40,760 
 She is constantly asking for money. 

18 
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:43,960 
 She actually wanted to move in with me and my kids. 

19 
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:45,800 
 My wife travels a lot. 

20 
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:46,960 
 I have two daughters, 

21 
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:49,640 
 and my sister told me she wanted to be closer. 

22 
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:51,280 
 She wanted to move into my home, 

23 
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:53,440 
 that it would be good for the girls to have a women 

24 
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:54,760 
 they could look up to. 

25 
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:57,720 
 She never liked that my wife travels. 

26 
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:0,080 
 This isn't the first time she has brought it up, 

27 
00:01:0,080 --> 00:01:3,640 
 and I have turned her down politely many times. 

28 
00:01:3,640 --> 00:01:6,480 
 My sister brought it up again last night. 

29 
00:01:6,480 --> 00:01:8,240 
 I told her no. 

30 
00:01:8,240 --> 00:01:10,240 
 This resulted in a heated conversation 

31 
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:12,200 
 with her asking why. 

32 
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:13,720 
 I decided to be honest, 

33 
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:15,960 
 and I told her that she isn't the type of women 

34 
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:18,240 
 I want my kids to look up to. 

35 
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:20,360 
 I also listed the reasons above. 

36 
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:22,160 
 She called me a jerk. 

37 
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:24,280 
 The family is now on my ass about this, 

38 
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:26,240 
 saying I was heartless to tell her that. 

39 
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:28,200 
 They also want me to apologize. 

40 
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:29,280 
 Am I the asshole?
